## Architecture decisions for high availability
{: #high-availability}

| Architecture decision | Requirement            | Options           | Decision      | Rationale  |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| High Availability of Application     | * Ensure application availability if outages occur. \n * Support SLA targets for availability. | * Single zone, single region  \n * Single zone, Multi region  | Single Zone, Multi Region | * By default, {{site.data.keyword.codeenginefull}} workload is deployed within a zone of a MZR region. If a failure of the hosting zone occurs, the workload is automatically re-created in one of the remaining zones. \n * To protect against regional failure workloads to be deployed across multiple MZR regions with automatic failover mechanism by leveraging an Edge Proxy service such as [{{site.data.keyword.cis_full}}](/docs/cis?topic=cis-getting-started).   |
| High Availability of Code Repository | Ensure code repository is available in case of a zone outage.     | Multiple zones       | Multiple zones   | * In each supported region, traffic is load balanced across registry infrastructure in multiple availability zones, with no single point of failure. \n * Data that is stored in {{site.data.keyword.registrylong}} is replicated over the availability zones and it is also backed up in another region regularly.     |

| Code Repository Backup    | Backup application images to enable recovery. | Default backup option of {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}}  | Default backup option of {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}}  | By default, data that is stored in {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} is replicated over the availability zones and it is also backed up in another region regularly. |

## Architecture decisions for disaster recovery
{: #disaster-recovery}

| Architecture decision | Requirement            | Options            | Decision          | Rationale     |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Disaster Recovery - application     | Highly resilient Application disaster recovery capability in secondary region to meet near zero RTO/RPO requirements. | * Active-Active \n * Active-Standby/Hot DR Site \n * Active-Standby/Warm DR Site \n * Backup & Restore (Cold DR Site) | Active-Active   | Recommended approach for highly resilient application by deploying resources in multiple regions of {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} and then using Global Load Balancer feature of [{{site.data.keyword.cis_short}}](/docs/cis?topic=cis-getting-started) to load balance between them. |
| Disaster Recovery â€“ Code Repository | Near zero RPO/RTO Code Repository availability for disaster recovery         | Leverage Default DR capability of Code Repository  DevOps pipeline to push images to multiple regions    | Leverage DevOps pipeline to push images to multiple regions | * Use Development pipeline to push images in multiple regions for near zero RPO/RTO capability. \n * Default RPO/RTO of {{site.data.keyword.registryshort}} is 48/24 hours which does not meet requirement of a highly resilient application with a near zero RPO/RTO.       |
