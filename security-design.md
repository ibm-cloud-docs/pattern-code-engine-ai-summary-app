# Security design
{: #security-design}

The [IBM Cloud速 Code Engine architecture](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-architecture) is built with a security-first mindset.
* IBM Cloud速 Code Engine components are [managed and owned by IBM](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/codeengine?topic=codeengine-responsibilities-ce).
* Customers and their workloads are isolated from each other by using projects, which are based on Kubernetes namespaces.
* Role-based access controls are performed on a resource level to allow only authorized users to perform certain operations on project resources.
* User access is controlled by Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM).
* Deployed apps are exposed through HTTPS and IBM Cloud速 Code Engine creates and manages the underlying TLS certifications automatically for you.
* IBM Cloud速 Code Engine provides immediate Layer-4 DDoS protection by Cloud Internet Services (CIS) at no additional cost to you.
